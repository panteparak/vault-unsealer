# 🏗️ New CI Architecture - Reusable Component System

## Overview

This document describes the new refactored CI/CD architecture built with reusable workflow components. The new system provides better modularity, consistency, and maintainability while significantly improving performance.

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modularity**
- Reusable workflow components for common operations
- Standardized inputs/outputs across all workflows
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Performance**
- Parallel execution where possible
- Smart caching strategies
- Conditional job execution

### 3. **Consistency**
- Standardized environment setup
- Unified configuration management
- Consistent error handling

### 4. **Observability**
- Comprehensive logging and reporting
- Quality gates and metrics
- Artifact management

## 📦 Reusable Components

### 🔧 reusable-setup.yaml
**Purpose**: Common environment setup for all workflows

**Capabilities**:
- Go, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes tools setup

- `config-hash`: Configuration hash for caching
- `vault-version`: Loaded Vault version
- `k3s-version`: Loaded K3s version

**Usage Example**:
```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-setup.yaml
with:
  go-version: "1.24"
  setup-docker: true
  setup-k8s: false
  cache-prefix: ci-primary

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Systems

### Configuration System
The new workflows seamlessly integrate with the existing `tests/config/` system:

```yaml
# Automatic loading in reusable-setup
VAULT_VERSION=$(grep -A5 "vault:" tests/config/versions.yaml | grep "default:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
K3S_VERSION=$(grep -A5 "k3s:" tests/config/versions.yaml | grep "default:" | cut -d'"' -f2)

# Environment variable overrides supported
VAULT_VERSION=${VAULT_VERSION:-"1.19.0"}
```

### Test Infrastructure
Leverages the existing TestContainers-based test infrastructure:

```bash
# Integration tests use shared utilities
make test-integration SCENARIO=basic-unsealing
make test-integration VAULT_VERSION=1.18.0

# Performance tests
make test-benchmark
make test-load-profile
```

### Build System
Maintains compatibility with existing Makefile targets:

```bash
# These commands work in both old and new systems
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-clean
make lint
```

# Get detailed run information
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### Quality Gates
The new system includes automated quality gates:

- **CI Status**: Must pass for PR merge
- **Security Threshold**: Configurable failure on HIGH/CRITICAL
- **Test Coverage**: Tracked and reported
- **Performance Regression**: Detected and reported
- **Chaos Testing**: System resilience validation

### Metrics and Reports
Every workflow generates comprehensive reports:

- **Test Coverage**: HTML and text reports
- **Security Scan**: SARIF files uploaded to GitHub Security
- **Performance**: CPU and memory profiles
- **Quality Summary**: Markdown reports with actionable recommendations

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Operation
- New workflows run alongside existing ones
- Compare results and performance
- Team training on new workflows

### Phase 2: Gradual Adoption
- Switch development branches to new workflows
- Update branch protection rules
- Monitor stability and performance

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Archive old workflows to `.archive/` folder
- Update all documentation
- Team adoption complete

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert branch protection rules to old workflow names
2. Re-enable old workflows (remove archive prefix)
3. Address issues and retry migration

## 🎓 Team Training

gh workflow run "🧪 Extended Testing (New)"

# Create release
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0

# Monitor security
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/code-scanning/alerts
```
