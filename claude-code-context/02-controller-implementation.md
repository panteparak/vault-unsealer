# Controller Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the VaultUnsealer controller with all core functionality.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Vault Client Implementation (`internal/vault/client.go`)
- Created Vault API client wrapper with proper TLS support
- Implemented key methods:
  - `GetSealStatus()` - Check seal status via `/v1/sys/seal-status`
  - `Unseal()` - Submit unseal keys via `/v1/sys/unseal`
- Added context support and proper error handling
- Supports custom TLS configuration for secure connections

### 2. Secrets Loader Implementation (`internal/secrets/loader.go`)
- Implemented multi-secret support as per specification
- Key features:
  - Load keys from multiple Kubernetes Secrets
  - Support both JSON array and newline-separated formats
  - Automatic key deduplication
  - Threshold-based key selection (limits to `keyThreshold` keys)
- Cross-namespace secret support with proper fallback to default namespace

### 3. Complete Controller Implementation (`internal/controller/vaultunsealer_controller.go`)
- **Reconciliation Logic**: Complete event-driven reconciliation loop
- **Pod Discovery**: Uses label selectors to find Vault pods
- **Pod Status Checking**: Ensures pods are ready before attempting unseal
- **Unsealing Workflow**: 
  - Checks seal status first
  - Submits keys sequentially until unsealed
  - Supports threshold-based unsealing
  - HA mode support (unseal all vs. stop after first)
- **Status Management**: Updates CR status with:
  - `PodsChecked` - List of pods that were processed
  - `UnsealedPods` - List of successfully unsealed pods
  - `Conditions` - Status conditions for different error states
  - `LastReconcileTime` - Timestamp of last reconciliation

### 4. Error Handling and Conditions
Implemented comprehensive condition types:
- `Ready` - Overall operator status
- `KeysMissing` - When secrets can't be loaded
- `VaultAPIFailure` - When Vault API calls fail
- `PodUnavailable` - When pods are not ready

### 5. RBAC Permissions
Updated controller with proper RBAC annotations:
```yaml
# VaultUnsealer CRD permissions
- groups: ops.autounseal.vault.io
  resources: vaultunsealers, vaultunsealers/status, vaultunsealers/finalizers
  verbs: get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete

# Kubernetes core resource permissions  
- groups: ""
  resources: pods, secrets, events
  verbs: get, list, watch, create, patch
```

### 6. Key Features Implemented
- **Multi-secret support**: Load keys from multiple secrets across namespaces
- **Threshold logic**: Only use required number of keys (`keyThreshold`)
- **HA awareness**: Support both HA and single-pod modes
- **TLS support**: Configurable TLS with CA bundles or insecure skip verify
- **Event-driven**: Reacts to pod and secret changes
- **Periodic reconciliation**: Configurable interval for safety checks
- **Comprehensive logging**: Structured logging throughout

### 7. Technical Implementation Details
- **Pod IP Resolution**: Dynamically constructs Vault URLs using pod IPs
- **TLS Configuration**: Supports CA bundle from secrets
- **Key Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate key submission
- **Status Updates**: Atomic status updates with proper error handling
- **Context Support**: All operations support Go contexts for cancellation

## Next Steps
1. Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring
2. Create comprehensive unit tests
3. Add example manifests and documentation
4. Implement e2e tests
